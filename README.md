### Live Broadcast Operations – Technical Case Study

Overview
During the past 2+ years, I've worked as a Technical Operator supporting a number of weekly live-streamed productions. My role was focused on backend activities: starting and monitoring live streams, coordinating stream schedules, ensuring signal quality, and troubleshooting technical problems in real-time.


### Tools & Technologies

* Operating Systems: macOS (primary), Windows, Linux (Ubuntu)

* Broadcast Tools: OBS, Evertz encoders, Evertz playback machines

* Audio & Comms: Dante audio-over-IP systems, Clear-Com

* Video Equipment: Blackmagic Design camera + recording equipment

* Remote Access: TeamViewer, in-control interfaces

* Comms & Coordination: Coordination with NOC teams and local operators


### My Role

* Initiated and managed 4–5 live streams per week

* Scheduled and double-checked event timing with Network Operations Centers

* Guaranteed uptime and signal stability for multiple simultaneous streams

* Monitored live feeds for technical issues (audio/video dropouts, sync issues)

* Managed between teams for live troubleshooting and resolving problems

* Conducted regular hardware checks and systems health reported

* Performed equipment resets, firmware revisions, and failover procedures


### Sample Day-to-Day Duties
Set up and monitored live streams, making sure audio and video signals were
working properly. Continuously tracked encoder performance and stream quality 
using internal dashboards and remote tools, and troubleshot issues as they came up.

### Skills Demonstrated
* Real-time operation in high-risk environments

* Multi-platform issue resolution (macOS, Linux, Windows)

* roadcast chain infrastructure knowledge (input to stream output)

* Clean coordination and communication with remote teams

### Example of signal flow

  (camera → encoder → stream → platform) ((simplified))



### Sample Technical Log – Stream Interruption (Resolved)
```bash

Date: March 2024

Stream Type: Broadcast to TV Platform

Problem: TV station feed went out

Noted By: Master Control operator

Solution:
Logged in to Evertz encoder software, 

found that the encoder had abruptly stopped streaming

Restarted the encoder

Verified with NOC operator that the stream was restored

Video resumed within 3–5 minutes of interruption


Post-Event Notes:
Updated encoder firmware
Marker encoder to keep a close eye on stability for live stream next week
```
