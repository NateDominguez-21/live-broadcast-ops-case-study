### Live Broadcast Operations – Technical Case Study

Overview
During the past 2+ years, I've worked as a Technical Operator supporting a number of weekly live-streamed productions. My role was focused on backend activities: starting and watching live streams, coordinating stream schedules, ensuring signal quality, and troubleshooting technical problems in real-time.


### Tools & Technologies

* Operating Systems: macOS (primary), Windows, Linux (Ubuntu)

* Broadcast Tools: OBS, Evertz encoders, Evertz playback machines

* Audio & Comms: Dante audio-over-IP systems, Clear-Com

* Video Equipment: Blackmagic Design camera + recording equipment

* Remote Access: TeamViewer, in-control interfaces

* Comms & Coordination: Coordination with NOC teams and local operators


### My Role

* Initiated and managed 4–5 live streams per week

* Scheduled and double-checked event timing with Network Operations Centers

* Guaranteed uptime and signal stability for multiple simultaneous streams

* Monitored live feeds for technical anomalies (audio/video dropouts, sync issues)

* Managed between teams for live troubleshooting and resolving problems

* Conducted regular hardware checks and systems health reported

* Performed equipment resets, firmware revisions, and failover procedures


### Sample Day-to-Day Duties
Deploy live streams and verify audio/video signal presence
Track encoder behavior and stream health for long periods of time
Stream failure analysis using internal dashboards and remote software
Report downstream team issues and record all technical problems

### Skills Demonstrated
Real-time operation in high-risk environments
Multi-platform issue resolution (macOS, Linux, Windows)
Broadcast chain infrastructure knowledge (input to stream output)
Awareness of signal flow (camera → encoder → stream → platform)
Clean coordination and communication with remote teams


### Sample Technical Log – Stream Interruption (Resolved)

Date: March 2024

Stream Type: Broadcast to TV Platform

Problem: TV station cut off feed

Noted By: Master Control operator

Solution:
Logged in to Evertz encoder UI remotely
Understood that the encoder had abruptly stopped streaming
Restarted the encoder
Verified with NOC operator that the stream was restored
Video resumed within 3–5 minutes of interruption
Post-Event Notes:

Updated encoder firmware
Marker encoder to keep a close eye on stability for live stream next week
