# ðŸŽ¥ Live Broadcast Operations â€“ Technical Case Study

## Overview

For the past 2+ years, I have worked as a **Technical Operator** supporting multiple weekly live-streamed events. My role focused on backend operations: starting and monitoring live streams, coordinating stream schedules, ensuring signal integrity, and resolving technical issues in real-time.

## Tools & Technologies

- **Operating Systems:** macOS (primary), Windows, Linux (Ubuntu)
- **Broadcast Tools:** OBS, Evertz encoders, Evertz playback machines
- **Audio & Comms:** Dante audio-over-IP systems, Clear-Com
- **Video Hardware:** Blackmagic Design camera + recording equipment
- **Remote Access:** TeamViewer, internal control interfaces
- **Comms & Coordination:** Collaboration with NOC teams and local operators

## My Responsibilities

- Initiated and monitored up to 4â€“5 live broadcasts per week
- Scheduled and verified event times with Network Operations Centers
- Maintained uptime and signal stability across multiple concurrent streams
- Monitored live feeds for technical anomalies (audio/video dropouts, sync issues)
- Coordinated across teams to troubleshoot and resolve issues live
- Conducted basic hardware checks and reported system health
- Managed equipment resets, firmware updates, and failover procedures

## Sample Day-to-Day Tasks

> - Launch live broadcasts and verify audio/video signal presence  
> - Observe encoder behavior and monitor stream health over long durations  
> - Troubleshoot stream failures using internal dashboards and remote tools  
> - Communicate issues to downstream teams and log all technical incidents  

## Skills Demonstrated

- Real-time operations under high-stakes conditions  
- Multi-platform troubleshooting (macOS, Linux, Windows)  
- Familiarity with broadcast chain infrastructure (from input to stream output)  
- Signal flow awareness (camera â†’ encoder â†’ stream â†’ platform)  
- Clear communication and coordination with remote teams
